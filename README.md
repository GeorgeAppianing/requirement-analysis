# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📘 Introduction
This repository is created to document and explore the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical stages in software development, as it lays the foundation for building a system that truly meets user needs and business objectives. This repository serves as a learning and reference resource for understanding, documenting, and applying requirement analysis principles in real-world software projects.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  

It involves understanding *what* the system should do (functional requirements) and *how* it should perform (non-functional requirements).  

The goal is to create a clear, agreed-upon set of requirements that guide the design, development, and testing phases of the project.

### 🔍 Key Activities:
- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Analysis:** Reviewing and refining gathered requirements for clarity and feasibility.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating formal documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) and use case diagrams.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that documented requirements align with stakeholder needs and business goals.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository
The main objectives of this repository are to:
- Explain the importance and process of requirement analysis.  
- Provide templates and examples for documenting requirements.  
- Include sample **use case diagrams** and **requirement specification documents**.  
- Serve as a learning resource for students, developers, and analysts studying SDLC.
