# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📘 Introduction
This repository is created to document and explore the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical stages in software development, as it lays the foundation for building a system that truly meets user needs and business objectives. This repository serves as a learning and reference resource for understanding, documenting, and applying requirement analysis principles in real-world software projects.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  

It involves understanding *what* the system should do (functional requirements) and *how* it should perform (non-functional requirements).  

The goal is to create a clear, agreed-upon set of requirements that guide the design, development, and testing phases of the project.

## 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is important because it ensures that the development team and stakeholders share a **common understanding** of what the system should achieve.  

A well-conducted requirement analysis helps to:
- ✅ Clearly define the **scope** of the project.  
- 💰 Prevent **cost overruns** and **delays** by reducing rework and misunderstandings.  
- 📈 Ensure that the **final product meets user expectations**.  
- 🧩 Identify potential **risks and constraints** early in the development cycle.  
- 🔒 Improve **system quality**, **security**, and **performance** through well-defined requirements.  
- 🤝 Strengthen collaboration and communication between technical teams and stakeholders.

## 🧭 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis typically involves several structured activities that help ensure all requirements are captured and validated effectively.

### 1. **Requirement Gathering**
- Collecting needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.  
- Identifying both functional and non-functional requirements.  

### 2. **Requirement Classification**
- Organizing requirements into categories such as business, user, functional, and system requirements.  
- Prioritizing requirements based on importance, feasibility, and business impact.

### 3. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
- Evaluating gathered requirements for consistency, completeness, and feasibility.  
- Representing requirements using **use case diagrams**, **data flow diagrams (DFD)**, and **entity-relationship diagrams (ERD)** for better understanding.  

### 4. **Requirement Documentation**
- Creating a formal record of all requirements in the form of a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.  
- Including detailed descriptions, diagrams, and acceptance criteria.  

### 5. **Requirement Validation**
- Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm that they accurately reflect business goals and user needs.  
- Ensuring all requirements are testable, clear, and feasible within project constraints.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements
Requirements in software development can be divided into several categories, each serving a specific purpose in defining the system’s behavior and performance.

### 1. **Business Requirements**
- High-level objectives that describe *why* the system is being developed.  
- They define the business goals, needs, and expected outcomes.  
- *Example:* Increase customer satisfaction through a faster booking system.

### 2. **User Requirements**
- Define *what* the users expect the system to do.  
- Typically written in natural language and often illustrated with use cases or user stories.  
- *Example:* Users should be able to reset their password via email.

### 3. **Functional Requirements**
- Specify the *functions and features* the system must provide.  
- They define the interaction between the system and its environment.  
- *Example:* The system shall allow users to search for properties by location, price, and availability.

### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
- Define *how* the system performs its functions rather than *what* it does.  
- Includes performance, security, scalability, usability, and reliability.  
- *Example:* The system must load search results within 2 seconds.

### 5. **System Requirements**
- Detailed technical specifications describing the hardware, software, and network configurations needed to support the system.  
- *Example:* The application must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository
The main objectives of this repository are to:
- Explain the importance and process of requirement analysis.  
- Provide templates and examples for documenting requirements.  
- Include sample **use case diagrams** and **requirement specification documents**.  
- Serve as a learning resource for students, developers, and analysts studying SDLC.
