# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìò Introduction
This repository is created to document and explore the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

Requirement Analysis is a crucial step in ensuring that software projects meet stakeholder expectations. It involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting requirements to define the scope and goals of a system before development begins.

## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying the needs and expectations of end-users for a new or modified product. It involves determining *what* the system should do, rather than *how* it should do it.

This process helps stakeholders and developers establish a shared understanding of the system‚Äôs objectives, scope, and constraints.

## üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is vital because:
- It ensures clear communication between stakeholders and developers.  
- It minimizes misunderstandings, rework, and project delays.  
- It helps define the project‚Äôs scope and prevents scope creep.  
- It improves software quality by ensuring the product meets user needs.  
- It forms the foundation for design, development, and testing.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Requirement Elicitation** ‚Äì Gathering information from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and observations.  
2. **Requirement Analysis and Negotiation** ‚Äì Analyzing and resolving conflicts among different requirements.  
3. **Requirement Documentation** ‚Äì Recording functional and non-functional requirements in a structured form.  
4. **Requirement Validation** ‚Äì Ensuring all requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with business goals.  
5. **Requirement Management** ‚Äì Tracking changes to requirements as the project evolves.  

## üß© Types of Requirements
1. **Functional Requirements** ‚Äì Define the specific behaviors or functions of the system (e.g., login, search, booking).  
2. **Non-Functional Requirements** ‚Äì Define system attributes such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.  
3. **Business Requirements** ‚Äì High-level objectives describing what the organization aims to achieve.  
4. **User Requirements** ‚Äì Statements from users describing what they expect the system to do.  
5. **System Requirements** ‚Äì Detailed technical specifications defining system operations and constraints.
